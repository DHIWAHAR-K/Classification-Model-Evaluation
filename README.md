# Classification Model Evaluation in Python

## Overview

This Python script demonstrates the evaluation of a classification model using common metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The provided script uses the `scikit-learn` library and a sample dataset to showcase the evaluation process. Explore this script to understand how to assess the performance of a classification model.

## Script Components

- **Library Installation:** Installing the necessary libraries (`scikit-learn`, `pandas`, and others if required).
- **Dataset Loading:** Loading a sample classification dataset or replacing it with your own data.
- **Model Training:** Training a classification model using `scikit-learn`.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the model's performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **User Input:** Code for user input to choose evaluation metrics.
- **Output Display:** Displaying the evaluation results.

## Running the Script

1. Install the required libraries by running `pip install scikit-learn pandas` in your Python environment.
2. Open and run the Python script (`classification_model_evaluation.py`) in a Python environment.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to choose a classification dataset and evaluation metrics.
4. The script will train the model, evaluate its performance, and display the results.

## Customization

- Replace the sample dataset with your own classification data for specific model evaluation.
- Experiment with different classification algorithms available in `scikit-learn`.
- Modify the script to include additional evaluation metrics or visualization options.
